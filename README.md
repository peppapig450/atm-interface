# AP Computer Science A Final Project

This is a Java project that simulates a basic ATM in the console.

My journal is on github [here](https://github.com/peppapig450/atm-interface)

## Running the Project

### Compiling yourself

If you want to compile and run the project yourself you need Apache Maven installed.
Go into the root directory of the project and run ```mvn clean compile assembly:single```
This should create a .jar in the `target` directory which we can use to run the project by executing
```shell
java -jar target/*.jar
```
